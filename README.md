<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Tuana</h1>
<h3 align="center">Graphics Programmer | Industrial and Software Engineer</h3>

Iâ€™m a graphics programmer with a foundation in **industrial engineering** and a strong interest in **software and low-level systems**. I enjoy understanding systems from the ground up and applying that knowledge to **end-to-end product development**, from low-level programming and graphics engines to real-time rendering and software deployment.

My work spans **graphics programming, real-time rendering, engine development**, alongside exploring core [computer science concepts](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). I approach each project with curiosity and a focus on learning through building.

This combination of industrial and software engineering gives me a **systematic perspective on planning, efficiency, and quality**, which complements my technical work.
